# Simplilearn – Intro To AI

### What is it?
AI is a branch of computer science dedicated to creating intelligent machines that work and react like humans.

### Types of AI
-	Reactive machines – don’t have memories, or past experiences. Specific Jobs
-	Limited Memory – Use past experience and present data to make decisions 
	- _E.g. Self driving cars_
-	Theory of Mind – Can Socialise and understand human emotions
    - _yet to be built_
-	Self Awareness – Superintelligent, sentient and concious

### Achieving AI
-	Machine Learning
-	Deep Learning
	-	Input layer, hidden layer, Output layer
	-	Uses old data to predict new data

### Applications of AI
-	Google Home

## Predicting risk of diabetes
The code used to create the model, and predict other patients risk is in the main.py file.
